# Get-Crackin
URP projekt

Get Crackin' is a 3rd person, hack n slash game.

Meet a furious chicken with a colorful sword!
This furious chickens’ family has just been slaughtered and served as dinner on the very same farm he was born on.
Unfortunately a storm hits the farm and it starts to rain heavily and the chicken is being washed far, far away. You as the player, will follow him on his way back for his revenge.

The player will fight its way with a floating combat system and slice it’s way through different kinds of enemies.
Enemies are lurking on every tiny path with their corresponding weapons, ready to stop the chickens' journey. For each enemy the chicken fights, his rage rises
and when it finally goes to his head, the adrenaline gives him extra power and extraordinary moves.
With these, the chicken seems unkillable! But use it in the right times, because it does not last for very long. Colors and particles
around the player work as a guidance for the chickens' mood. No colors signifies his regular mood but as the particles blossoms up and surrounds him with
colors, his rage does as well.
Finding the way through the game will come naturally, as the map itself guides you in the right direction.

You start at point A, beside a tiny cabin which indicates a calm place but the calmness disappears just a few steps away.
Then fight your way to point B, significantly less calm. Point B is the end of the map where the last enemies are.
Defeat these and you win the game! You may not come all the way back to the farm, but at least you managed to escape the fox-filled forest and can live
without the fear of getting eaten by the foxes in your sleep.
The story is told by text on the screen which is implemented through a cutscene in the beginning of the game. When finished the game, a final cutscene will
show in which the story is told through an animated cutscene.
To get the player to understand the game logics and mechanics, a small-scaled tutorial will be presented at the beginning of the game. This will
consist of interactable objects and facing enemies in combat. The tutorial is placed in the down right corner so it is not in the way or distracting
the player and can be ignored if the player chooses to.
